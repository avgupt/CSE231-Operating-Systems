# Understanding Program Compilation Process
Write out a simple C program â€“ hello.c, that would have two
local variables intialised to some values. Thereafter, you print them out via
printf() function and exit the program. Your task is to use gcc compiler to
walk through all the steps of compilation. The first step would be to pause at
the pre-processing step. You need to explain the output of the pre-processing,
based on the output file (derived by pausing the compilation at the preprocessing
step). Thereafter, you need go via all the compilation steps and pause at each
step, save the output file and explain the contents in each of these output files.
